# pancake-recipe
This is a recipe blog page for banana egg pancakes using HTML and CSS/SASS.
**note: please do not take the picture as it was taken by me of some actual banana egg pancakes I made

I wanted to try making a sample blog page website/mockup for some banana egg pancakes I made (which were quite delicious by the way). 
I love when a blog has a cute, relaxed vibe, so that was the aesthetic I was going for. 

Provided in the files are both CSS and SASS files for styling (I ended up styling both just for practice).
