# pancake-recipe
This is a recipe blog page for banana egg pancakes using HTML and CSS/SASS.

**note(picture on the app was taken by me and pancakes were made by me, so please do not upload picture to web)

I wanted to try making a sample blog page website/mockup for some banana egg pancakes I made (which were quite delicious by the way). 
For this blog, I wanted to go for a minimalistic, neat, readable design. Included are things that a blog typically would have such as a sign-up form and a search bar. 

Provided in the files are both CSS and SASS files for styling (I ended up styling both just for practice).

Limitations: 
- This blog page, since based off of only HTML and CSS, has no real functionality and is more of a layout/website design.
