<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
This is a recipe blog page for banana egg pancakes I built using HTML and CSS/SASS (both files included in the repository). For this blog, I wanted to go for a minimalistic, neat, readable design. Included are things that a blog typically would have such as a sign-up form and a search bar. 

**note (I took the photos of the actual food I made so please do not use my photos for any use)

### Motivation
As someone who loves baking and trying new recipes (that sometimes fail), I often use various cooking or baking blogs for random recipes I want to try. Since my friends have often told me that I should start a small business selling my baked goods, I thought it would be cool to create a blog page for something. To keep it simple, I based it on some banana egg pancakes I've made several times in the past (they are healthy and delicious btw!).

### Reflection
Unfortunately since this project is marking the start of my web development journey, and there is no JavaScript in the project, the site doesn't have much functionality. However, building this site did allow me to practice my HTML and CSS/SASS. I ended up doing the styling in SASS after CSS just for practice and I do prefer to use SASS instead of pure CSS. In my current position, I typically style a website using a mockup usually provided through Figma. Since I had no mockup to follow this time and had to create the website design myself, the process forced me to think about design elements such as the background of the website, the font, and text and image placing. This took a lot longer than expected because even little details, such as text and background color contrast, had to be thought about! 

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
