        <h2>What makes these better than regular pancakes?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>They're healthier than regular pancakes! </strong>Since these pancakes are only made of eggs and bananas, these pancakes are loaded with protein and potassium, and are a lot healthier than traditional pancakes. </li>
          <li><strong>They're quick to make!</strong> The perfect breakfast when you're in a time crunch to go to work or school. Also great when you're just feeling lazy and want pancakes and food ASAP(me lol).</li>
          <li><strong>They require minimal cleanup!</strong>Personally one of the parts I hate about baking or cooking is using a bunch of kitchenware and having to clean it up afterwards. This recipe only requires one mixing bowl, a fork, pan/griddle, and a spatula! </li>
          <li><strong>They're made with only 2 ingredients! </strong>Most people already have these 2 ingredients in their kitchen, and if not, they're easy to find at your grocery store.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2 id='recipe'>2 Ingredient Banana Egg Pancake Recipe</h2>
            <p>Prep time: 5 minutes</p>
            <p>Cook time: 3 minutes</p>
            <p>Yields: 1 serving</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 banana (preferably ripe)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Butter or oil to cook the pancakes</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 bowl</li>
            <li>1 spatula</li>
            <li>1 fork</li>
            <li>Pan or griddle for frying the pancake</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Use the fork to mash the banana in one bowl thoroughly (you want it to be all mushy).</li>
            <li>Whisk the 2 eggs into the banana mixture so the mixture is blended well without lumps.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pan or griddle with the cooking oil/butter of your choice.</li>
            <li>Drop 2 tablespoons of the batter onto the hot pan. Cook until edges are set and center is slightly loose, then flip onto the other side. Repeat as necessary until pancake is cooked thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Finally the exciting part! Serve your pancakes with toppings and sauces of your choice and enjoy! My favorites include topping with honey, maple syrup, strawberries, and whipped cream.</li>
